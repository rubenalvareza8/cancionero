<center>Saturday morning, jumped out of bed <br>
And put on my best suit <br>
Got in my car and raced like a jet <br>
All the way to you <br>
Knocked on your door with heart in my hand <br>
To ask you a question <br>
'Cause I know that you're an old-fashioned man <br>
Yeah (yeah) <br>
<p></p>
Can I have your daughter for the rest of my life? <br>
Say yes, say yes, 'cause I need to know <br>
You say I'll never get your blessing 'til the day I die <br>
"Tough luck, my friend, but the answer is no" <br>
<p></p>
Why you gotta be so rude? <br>
Don't you know I'm human too? <br>
Why you gotta be so rude? <br>
I'm gonna marry her anyway <br>
(Marry that girl) marry her anyway <br>
(Marry that girl) yeah, no matter what you say <br>
(Marry that girl) and we'll be a family <br>
Why you gotta be so rude? <br>
<p></p>
I hate to do this, you leave no choice <br>
Can't live without her <br>
Love me or hate me <br>
We will be both standing at that alter <br>
Or we will run away to another galaxy, you know <br>
You know she's in love with me <br>
She will go anywhere I go <br>
<p></p>
Can I have your daughter for the rest of my life? <br>
Say yes, say yes, 'cause I need to know <br>
You say I'll never get your blessing 'til the day I die <br>
"Tough luck, my friend, 'cause the answer is still no" <br>
<p></p>
Why you gotta be so rude? <br>
Don't you know I'm human too? <br>
Why you gotta be so rude? <br>
I'm gonna marry her anyway <br>
(Marry that girl) marry her anyway <br>
(Marry that girl) no matter what you say <br>
(Marry that girl) and we'll be a family <br>
Why you gotta be so rude? <br>
<p></p>
Rude <br>
(Why you gotta be so-) <br>
<p></p>
Can I have your daughter for the rest of my life? <br>
Say yes, say yes, 'cause I need to know <br>
You say I'll never get your blessing 'til the day I die <br>
"Tough luck, my friend, no still means no" <br>
<p></p>
Why you gotta be so rude? <br>
Don't you know I'm human too? <br>
Why you gotta be so rude? <br>
I'm gonna marry her anyway <br>
(Marry that girl) marry her anyway <br>
(Marry that girl) no matter what you say <br>
(Marry that girl) and we'll be a family <br>
Why you gotta be so rude? <br>
<p></p>
Oh, yeah, oh <br>
Why you gotta be so rude? <br>
Why? (Yeah) <br>
Why you gotta be so rude? <br></center>
